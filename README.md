# My_Zork
This is a work-in-progress game based off of the text-based game "Zork".  It is a personal project that I am passionate about, but have had to put off due to midterms and other responsibilities, but have started to continue working on.  It is not yet in a playable state, but I believe looking at the main function should give some idea of how I intend the game to run given more time.
