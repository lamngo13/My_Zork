# My_Zork
This is a work-in-progress game based off of the text-based game "Zork".  "Zork" is a video game from the early age of computers where players input text commands to move their character around a fantasy world.  It is a personal project that I am passionate about, but have had to put off due to midterms and other responsibilities, but have started to continue working on.  Right now, this project is in an early stage but you can move your player around an access your inventory.  This project demonstrates concepts about programming in general but specifically object-oriented programming.  I will be continually adding functionality!  In the meantime, please run the main class.
